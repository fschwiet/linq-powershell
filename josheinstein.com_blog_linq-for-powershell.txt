LINQ for PowerShell

Download LINQ.psm1

Im gonna start off by saying the module Im posting about does not follow the PowerShell naming guidelines. In fact, not only does it use non-standard verb names, but the "verb" part of all the function names arent even verbs. I hate breaking the rules like this but the Verb-Noun naming couldnt really group these functions together the way I wanted and naming them correctly would have been very difficult. So feel free to rename as needed.

A while back I posted about a ConvertTo-Dictionary PowerShell function. This handy little function would take an input object from the pipeline and populate a Hashtable using a key selector and optional value selector. Very similar to how LINQs ToDictionary method works. It uses ScriptBlocks in the same way C# uses lambda expressions. There is one very nice trick in the module. A function called Invoke-ScriptBlock that shows how to inject a $_ (dollar underbar) variable into a ScriptBlocks scope when invoking it. This is very handy for simulating lambdas in PowerShell functions.

Anyhow, over time I added several more LINQ-like functions and then I just went all out and tried to implement all the most popular LINQ methods. I managed to get a good deal done although there is still some documentation work needed. Some of the functions may seem redundant because they have nearly the same functionality as existing PowerShell cmdlets. In these cases its usually because I thought it could be more LINQ-like. For example I have Linq-Min because its simpler and more flexible than Measure-Object. But I didnt duplicate Where-Object because there was no point.

The following code example shows how you might use these functions. Not all of them are shown. Notice the lamba-like syntax for predicates, selectors, etc. They also make use of the convenient $_ (dollar underbar) variable to represent the "current item" which makes them more consistent with Where-Object, Foreach-Object, etc.
